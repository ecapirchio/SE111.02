                <p>The show Friends is by far the best show I've ever watched. Although, I may be bias because I grew up with this show on constantly. This show brings back childhood memories because my mom would always have it on after school while we were doing homework or while she was making dinner.</p>
                <p>Overall, the show is five stars for me due to the writers and the comedic timing as well as the characters reading the lines. The actors were chosen perfectly for their roles and all work very well together. This makes the show even more interesting to watch.</p>
